            I was born and brought in the beautiful place in “northern bengal”
            based out in “India.” if you ever visit my place we might have a tea
            together someday produced just nearby my home.

            getting into Computer Science & Engineering which i had no idea how
            will do by just having a interest of computers. Hostel is one the
            best things happened to my life. “It taught how to live a life”. I
            was always a introvert & extrovert too depends upon the people i am
            surrounded with. I still miss the 2 AM hostel stories & the birthday
            bashes. being a last bencher i have seen the whole class in a
            different way. nevermind , anyone reading this from SMIT do react
            out @rohanprasadofficial on insta , i am super active there. Atlast
            , i am 2020 batch graduating virtually where pre well planned things
            got ruined.
